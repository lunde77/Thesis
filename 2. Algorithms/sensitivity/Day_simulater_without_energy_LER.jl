### input:

# Total_flex_up:    The total downwards flexibility of the entiery portefolio relative to baseline - 1440
# ac_do_m:          The percentual maximum upwards activation for all minutes - % - 1xM
# ac_up_m:          The percentual maxsimum downwards activation for all minutes - % - 1xM
# La_up:            The price for the bids upwards - DKK 1x24
# La_down:          The price for the bids downwards - DKK 1x24
# C_do:             The aggregated downwards bid for all minutes  - kW - 1xM

### output:

# M_A:              How much of the activation were not meet - up and down [2]
