FOLDERS;

Models: This is where the decesion making models are placed, 

Algoritmer: This is where non decesion making function are placed. 

Simulations: This where the models and algoritmer are brought togehter, to create a function, that will generate a simulation

Test: Results files are stored here. It's important to note, what inputs are given to each input, and the data, so potential differences in scripts can be detected.

Data clearning: Here the data is generated based on the original data
